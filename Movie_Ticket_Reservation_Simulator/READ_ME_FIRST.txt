Hello readers!



This project is a Movie Ticket Reservation Simulator developed by Aaryan Urunkar. It covers many of the features 
and promopts generally observed while booking a movie ticket. The technology majorly used here is Java swing. I have made
this project dynamic .i.e. the first time you run and book a few tickets, the second time those same seats will not be 
available for booking.

  My project comprises of 3 classes:
  1] RunCode.java
  2] Reservation.java
  3] FileMethods.java

  RunCode class is the entry point into the project and also responsible for the home page. The JButtons are prompts to 
  various features of my projects such as ticket reservation, modification, seat count, ticket cancellation and checking
  cost of reservation of any particular account. Since reservation is a bigger process compared to the others, a whole
  separate class is dedicated to it whereas all other features are in FileMethods.java.

  Along with classes, several .txt files are also associated with the project. Those files are responsible for storing data
  of users(seats booked, cost, email etc.). 

  I hope you enjoyed being a user of this project!
